### **Journal of Work (April 7 - April 10)**

#### **April 7, 1:55 PM**
- Finished the forwarding unit.
- Fixed an issue in the pipelining registers.

#### **April 7, 4:30 PM**
- Started working on the ALU module.
- Added support for ADDI, ANDI, ORI, XORI, SLTI, SLTIU, LUI, AUIPC, and FENCE instructions.

#### **April 8, 10:00 AM**
- Fixed synthesis errors in the ALU module.
- Replaced macros with explicit bit patterns (e.g., `4'b0000`).

#### **April 8, 2:15 PM**
- Updated the `CU` (Control Unit) module to support the required instructions.
- Added support for FENCE and AUIPC in the control signals.

#### **April 8, 5:45 PM**
- Modified the `ImmGen` module to generate immediate values for all supported instructions.
- Fixed issues with opcode handling using explicit bit patterns instead of macros.

#### **April 9, 11:00 AM**
- Worked on the `TopModule` to integrate all components.
- Fixed PC width mismatches and added proper branching logic.
- Integrated the `BranchingUnit` module into the `TopModule`.

#### **April 10, 11:30 AM**
- Created a testbench for verifying all supported instructions.
- Initialized instruction memory with test cases for ADDI, ANDI, ORI, XORI, SLTI, SLTIU, LUI, AUIPC, and FENCE.
